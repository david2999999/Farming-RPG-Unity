# Farming-RPG-Unity

Description
Have you ever wanted to create your own Farming RPG?  Games like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon have been incredibly successful, 
and you too can develop your own game with the help of this course. We'll explain how to develop many of the core systems and game functionality.  
We'll start with a blank project and then develop the game lecture by lecture, covering all the code and Unity configuration you will need.  
This course is massive with over 44 hours of lecture videos, 99 lectures, a starter assets pack, and a complete Unity project that you can 
download to follow along. We even provide another Unity project to demonstrate AStar pathfinding! So while it took the creator of Stardew 
Valley over 4 years to create his game, you can get a head start by using this course, potentially saving many months or even years of 
development time !  This is one of the most comprehensive intermediate Unity 2D development courses on Udemy.  We hope that you decide 
to take the course and join the thousands of students who have already taken their next steps in advancing their Unity game development 
skills using a sophisticated, intermediate project based course.  I look forward to seeing you in the lectures!
